Integrated cir
cuits or ICs fo
r short (sometimes ju
st referred to as "chips") 
are specialized circuits that serv
e a huge variety of purp
oses, such as contr
olling a robot's mo
tors or making LE
Ds respond to m
usic. Many ICs c
ome in something called a dual in-line package, or DIP, meaning they have two parallel rows of pins. The gap 
in the middle o
f a breadboard (between columns 
E a
nd F) is ju
st the ri
ght width f
or an IC t
o fit, strad
dling the gap, w
ith one set of pi
ns in column
 E, and one set 
 of pins in column F.
