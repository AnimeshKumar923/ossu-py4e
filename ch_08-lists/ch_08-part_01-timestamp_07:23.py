# string are immutable, i.e., they cannot be changed by code. They remain as they were in the initial assigned state.

# lists are mutable, i.e., they can be changed by writing code with replacement of an element being an example of it. Index operator is used to change/replace the element.

# lists can be made using square brackets []
